## Abstract

> Transportation distance data is a powerful resource, but granular location records are often censored due to privacy concerns or regulatory mandates. We describe the *transportation event distance distribution reconstruction* problem, which aims to handle this obstacle and has broad application to public health informatics, logistics, and more. We propose numerical methods to approximate, sample from, and compare distributions of distances between censored loscation pairs. We validate empirically on synthetic simulated data and demonstrate applicability to practical geospatial data analysis tasks. Our code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/lmiconsulting/teddr).
